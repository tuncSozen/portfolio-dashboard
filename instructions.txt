I want to build a dashboard for my portfolio using python and plotly.

There are 3 excel files onthis folder:
- portfolio.xlsx which contains description, value and other info on each asset
- twrr.xlsx which contains 3 sheets (one for each bank) showing monthly return performance
- evolutionPL.xlsx which contains a column for each bank showing a simple cash flow statement

Here are some bulletpoints:

Design & Layout
- create an css file for layout
- use plotly
- use dark mode
- there will be a sidebar on the left side
- 2 tabs on the sidebar named Summary and Banks
- create 9 containers for each page (3 rows by 3 columns)

Portfolio file
- Have a look at the contents of the portfolio.xlsx.
- Create 3 dataframes from portfolio by filtering Bank column with each bank name i.e. BBVA, UBS and LO

TWRR file
- Have a look at the contents of the twrr.xlsx.
- Create 3 dataframes from twrr (one for each bank) by loading excel file with the sheet named after a bank

Banks tab
- On banks tab, each vertical column will be representing one of the banks (lets call these Bank Columns)
- 1st row of each column will be a donut chart - use Type and Value_USD columns
- Second row of each column will be a line plot with x-axis Date time-series and Y-axis Cum. TWRR column
- LEave the 3rd row containers blank for now

Summary tab
- Leave this blank for now


Let me create the new page with 6 containers in a 2x3 grid, where the first container has 4 smaller metric containers in a 2x2 layout.
